# Milestone project 2
This is a milestone project 2 for Code Institute and Runshaw College.
## 1. Purpose of the project
### 1.1. Developer and business goals
## 2. User stories
## 3. Features
### 3.1. Existing features
## 4. Future features
## 5. Typography and color scheme
## 6. Wireframes
I used Balsamiq to create my wireframe, which you can check here [Link to the wireframe](Language learning app.pdf). There are wireframes for 3 different screen sizes (desktop computer, tablet, phone), and my project contains more sections, so people can scroll down to read them. I modified my wireframe a couple of times; this is the latest version. This wireframe helped me to position things and organize my content.
## 7. Technologies used
* I used HTML to create the layout and the basic structure for the website.
* CSS to style the website.
* JavaScript to create a memory game.
* Bootstrap to speed up the developing process and help with accessibility and responsibility. Bootstrap and CSS media queries ensure, that the layout changes appropriately across different device screen sizes.
* I used Balsamiq for my wireframe, so I could think about the structure of my website, size the features, and see how things can work/function.
* I used git for version control.
* I used GitHub to save my repository and deploy my project online.
* I used Microsoft Paint to create and edit pictures.
## 8. Testing
### 8.1. Code validation
### 8.2. Test cases
### 8.3. Fixed bugs
### 8.4. Supported screens and browsers
## 9. Deployment
### 9.1. via VS Code
### 9.2. via GitHub Pages
1. I connected Visual Studio Code with my GitHub account.
2. I committed and pushed all of my new code regularly to GitHub.
3. Inside the milestone-project-1 repository I went to Settings > Pages, and I deployed from the main branch.
4. When my site was live, I could visit it from here.
## 10. Credits
* I have to say a big thank you to Runshaw College and Code Institute for guiding me and helping me with this project.
* For inspiration I used [JavaScript Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWdkt6KSirw).
